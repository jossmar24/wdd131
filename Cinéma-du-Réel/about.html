      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="./images/me.jpg" alt="My profile picture" loading="lazy">
      <p>Hello! I'm Josselyn Martinez I really like cinematographic art, since I really enjoy the music, the visual effects and the talent behind each film.</p>
      <p>I love this type of viewing, as there are times when documentaries transport me to special moments in my life.</p>

      <h3>My cinematic journey</h3>
      <p>Before, it didn't catch my attention, however, as time went by, I discovered how fascinating it can be to immerse yourself in a well-told story, connect with the characters and experience different emotions through cinema.</p>
      <p>I don't consider watching an international documentary film festival to be a waste of time, but rather a valuable hobby that allows me to relax, be entertained, and, on many occasions, learn something new.</p>

      <h3>My favorite documentaries</h3>
      <p>Among my favorites are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Succession:</strong> A chilling look at the heart of a dysfunctional family in the media and entertainment empire.</li>
        <li><strong>More alive than ever:</strong> It will feature filmmakers with a very lively style.</li>
        <li><strong>Vourdalak:</strong> Vourdalak presents a strange family that lives in the middle of the countryside. A pale and powdery individual presents himself as an emissary of the King of France.</li>
        <li><strong>L’Art du muet:</strong> It begins with a false quote from Bushido: “There is no loneliness deeper than that of the samurai". Only the tiger in the jungle can compare with it.</li>
      </ul>
